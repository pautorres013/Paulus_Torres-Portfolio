      "summary": "My character modeling, rigging, and animation project with a strong focus on anime-style shaders and experience in PBR 3D models.",
      "description": "This section of my portfolio showcases my expertise in 3D rigging, modeling, and animation. My work primarily features anime-style shaders, though I also have experience creating realistic 3D models. I specialize in Blender for modeling, utilize Auto-Rig Pro and custom rigs for rigging, and use Substance Painter for texturing. Additionally, I develop models optimized for Unity environments, including metaverse projects. Since 2023, I have been working as a freelance 3D Rigging Artist with Narrasoft Inc., where I have gained industry experience and refined both my technical and artistic skills.",
      "workflow": "<ol class = 'text-left px-10'><li class = 'paragraphs'>Modeling:<br>The modeling process begins with the concept art, which is typically provided by my clients. I start by capturing the silhouette of the concept and defining its depth through shading and perspective. From there, I create a draft model that represents about 80% of the reference, ensuring the fundamental structure and proportions are accurate.<br><br></li><li class = 'paragraphs'>Rigging:<br>For rigging, I assess the concept art to determine the appropriate shading style—whether realistic or anime-inspired. This guides my workflow. For anime-style rigs, I study references from anime and VTuber models to understand expression and movement dynamics. For realistic models, I gather extensive references to ensure accurate muscle and joint movements. When working with hard surface models, such as mechas or robots, I design the rig based on its mechanical functions. For instance, a Gundam model would simulate humanoid movement while maintaining the rigid, robotic feel. <br><br><li class = 'paragraphs'>Animation:<br>The animation process builds upon the rig, ensuring smooth and expressive motion that aligns with the model's style and purpose. I apply principles of weight, balance, and timing to create natural and engaging animations, whether for interactive Unity environments or cinematic sequences.</li></ol>",
