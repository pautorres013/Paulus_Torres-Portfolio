    "aboutme": "I'm a versatile professional with experience across multiple industries, blending creativity, technical expertise, and analytical problem-solving. As a Multimedia Designer and 3D Rigging Artist, I've worked on game assets, animations, 3D printing, and motion design, bringing ideas to life through engaging visuals. My hands-on experience as a Print Press Operator has strengthened my attention to detail and quality control. Beyond creative work, I have a background in manual testing, ensuring software quality and functionality. My analytical side extends to tutoring, where I provided non-voice SQL database support, helping students understand complex database concepts. Additionally, my time as a Summer HR Intern gave me insights into organizational processes and team dynamics. This diverse skill set allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectivesâ€”whether in design, technology, or quality assurance. I thrive on learning and adapting to new challenges, always eager to expand my expertise and contribute to impactful projects.",
